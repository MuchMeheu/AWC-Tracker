## Development Setup (For Contributors or Local Use)

If you wish to run this project locally or contribute:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MuchMeheu/AWC-Tracker.git
    cd AWC-Tracker
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your AniList Client ID:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_ANILIST_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ANILIST_CLIENT_ID_HERE
    REACT_APP_ANILIST_API_DELAY_MS=4000 # Optional: Default API delay in milliseconds
    REACT_APP_VERSION=0.5.0 # Set your current app version
    ```
    *   You need to register a new API client on AniList (under Developer settings) to get a `CLIENT_ID`. Set the "Redirect URL" for your AniList client to your local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Known Issues / Future Ideas

*   **Rate Limiting:** While there's a delay implemented for AniList API calls, adding extremely large challenges or performing many actions quickly might still hit AniList's rate limits, especially if their API is in a degraded state. A more sophisticated queuing/retry mechanism could be an improvement.
*   **CORS in Development:** If you encounter CORS issues when fetching from AniList locally, ensure you have disabled any interfering browser extensions or consider using a CORS unblocker extension *for development only*. The `proxy` setting in `package.json` is not currently configured for this project but could be added.
*   **Different Emojis not being recognized by the App:** Even if you think you have the right emojis visually they may be different due to different Unicodes.
*   **Adding a backend to avoid parsing info about anime every time** Want to add a backend and server storage to rely less on API calls and reduce stress on the server and the API, which is ALMOST ALWAYS in a degraded state ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ.
*   **Adding a bit of sorting and searching features**: Self-explanatory
